# STAT 545A Collaborative Project: Milestone 1
This respository is the **STAT 545A Collaborative Project: Milestone 1** for _Group 23_. 
### Files
In this Github Repository we have created three files:
1. Team Work Contract
2. Readme File (includes project discription)
3. Troubleshooting Document

#### Team Work Contract
The team work contract includes an agreement on the *Division of Labour*, and, *Timing*, and *Communication*. Based on a group conversation we decided on the parameter of this contract and it can be found under TEAMWORK.md on the main branch. _To open the file you can download the file and open in R/Rstudio or clone this repository into R/Rstudio_. 

#### Readme File
This is the Readme File. It provides context and how-to instructions for the project. _To open the file you can download the file and open in R/Rstudio or clone this repository into R/Rstudio_. 

#### Troubleshooting Document
The [Troubleshooting Document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/collaborative-project/milestone1/troubleshooting-1.Rmd) was brought into the respository and the three errors were fixed in Rstudio and knit to an md file. To complete this part of the project download the [Troubleshooting Document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/collaborative-project/milestone1/troubleshooting-1.Rmd) and fix the errors in Rstudio, knit, and push it back to the repository.
